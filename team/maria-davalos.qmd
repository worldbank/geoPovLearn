## Bio

María Eugenia Dávalos is a Senior Economist driving analysis and evidence-based policy design to expand economic opportunity and reduce poverty. She has worked across Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe and Central Asia, and brings together analytics and operations on economic mobility, distributional impact of policies and shocks, labor markets, gender, migration, and inequality. In the past few years, María has increasingly focused her work on how place shapes life chances and how spatially targeted solutions can promote more inclusive growth. Her recent policy-oriented research has focused on a geographic lens to inequality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility, and ongoing work on the geography of labor markets and job quality. Beyond her analytical experience, her operational work has leveraged the Bank’s financing instruments to turn diagnostics into policy reform.
