## Overview

This seminar provides an overview of how we can harness the power of AI in our daily analytical work. Essential tools that can significantly improve your analysis and coding workflow will be demonstrated.

Any task involving coding in Stata or R/Python programming languages can be more efficiently performed with the help of AI (such as Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot). However, using AI solely through a web browser or Windows Copilot captures only a fraction of its potential.

To enhance the efficiency and scope of your work, we can integrate WB-approved software (VS Code) that can incorporate AI-Agents and run Stata or R code directly. This will enable you to leverage AI in your daily analysis, make AI aware of your context, and prompt it to write code specifically to your data and objectives.

The goal of this seminar is to introduce these tools, demonstrate their potential and limitations, and provide a starting point for you to explore AI assistance independently.

## What You Will Learn

During this first session, we will:

- **Demonstrate how to use AI assistance in daily coding**
- **Briefly introduce key AI-relevant concepts:**
  - AI-Chat versus AI-Agent
  - Context awareness and model communication protocol (MCP)
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): VS Code
- **Explain the software setup needed to leverage AI agents in analysis:**
  - Positron/VS Code
  - GitHub and [https://github.com/worldbank](https://github.com/worldbank)
  - GitHub Copilot and access to Claude LLM for coding models
- **Show step-by-step practical cases of AI application** to produce high-quality analysis based on a general task of "reproducibility package preparation":
  - How and where to start
  - Effective prompt generation
  - Performing analysis
  - Quality control, validation and preventing hallucinations
- **Discuss further potential uses of AI-Agents** in our everyday work
