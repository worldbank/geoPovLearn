## About the GeoPov Series

This webinar series creates a platform for dialogue on how geospatial data can strengthen analysis and policy discussions aimed at reducing poverty and vulnerability. It has two main objectives:

1. **Showcasing impactful applications** – highlighting country experiences and operational work where geospatial tools have improved poverty analysis, targeting, and decision-making. These cases illustrate models with potential for scaling up and replication in other contexts.

2. **Sharing technical knowledge** – presenting innovative geospatial data sources, tools, and methodologies relevant for economists and practitioners working at the country level, with a focus on practical skills.

Through these conversations, the series seeks to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technical innovations and their use in shaping policies that can make a measurable difference for the poorest and most vulnerable populations.

**Suggestions for future topics and speakers are warmly welcome** – please reach out to Henry Stemmler ([hstemmler@worldbank.org](mailto:hstemmler@worldbank.org)).
