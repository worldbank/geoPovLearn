## Overview

What happens when household surveys meet geospatial data? The Global Monitoring Database (GMD)—the World Bank's harmonized repository of household surveys—now includes geocoded variables that capture the spatial context of interviewed households.

Using a global grid system (H3 hexagons), survey locations are linked to powerful spatial indicators such as population density, urbanization, nighttime lights, accessibility, and climate. Nearly 100 surveys across 44 low- and middle-income countries—representing about 3 million households—have already been mapped to more than 130,000 unique locations.

This integration opens new doors for analysis, allowing researchers and practitioners to combine household data with geospatial insights to better understand living conditions and inform policy.
