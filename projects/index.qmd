Our work is organized around three main pillars that guide our approach to integrating geospatial data with poverty analysis.

## Our Three Pillars

### [Spatial Analysis](spatial-analysis.qmd)

Applying a geographic lens to pressing policy questions on poverty and inequality.

### [Knowledge and Data Center](knowledge-data-center.qmd)

Building a curated repository of geospatial data sources and methods for poverty analysis.

### [Capacity Building](capacity-building.qmd)

Demystifying geospatial data for microeconomists through hands-on training and peer-learning.
