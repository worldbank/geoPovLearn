## Goals:

-   Setup software environment for AI agent-assisted analysis in Stata and R
-   Enable GitHub Copilot or Claude AI integration
-   Be able to reproduce AI-assisted coding workflow demonstrated in the seminar

## Software setup

### Step 1. Prerequisites software: Stata, R, Python

1.  Go to the World Bnk Software Center App and install of the following software (if not already installed):

    ![](images/software-center.png){width="212"}

    | Software | Version | Notes |
    |----------|---------|-------|
    | ![](images/stata.png){width="40"} **Stata** | 19 or higher (latest available) | |
    | ![](images/R.png){width="40"} **R** | 4.5.2 (latest) | |
    | ![](images/python.png){width="40"} **Python** | 3.13+ (latest) | |
    | ![](images/quarto.png){width="40"} **Quarto** | 1.3.343 (latest) | May require software installation request |
    | ![](images/git.png){width="40"} **Git** | 2.52+ (latest) | |
    | ![](images/ghdesktop.png){width="40"} **GitHub Desktop** | Latest | Optional |

### Step 2. Install important python package

1.  Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell:

    -   Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` or `powershell`, and hit Enter.
01
2.  Type `pip install uv` and press Enter to install the `uv` package.

    -   `uv` is a package that allows environments management in python, see [https://pypi.org/project/uv/](https://pypi.org/project/uv/){target="_blank"}

3.  Check if UV is installed correctly by typing `uv --version` in the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    You should see the version number of UV displayed.
    Someting like this:

    ```
    uv 0.9.18 (0cee76417 2025-12-16)
    ```

### Step 3. Install Positron (IDE) [^1]

[^1]: Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your IDE.
    Overall, we encourage using Positron because of its better context awareness when developing R/Stata and other analysis scripts.
    If you opt using VS Code, it could be installed form the software center.
    Please note that some steps below may differ slightly when using VS Code instead of Positron.
    In addition, VS code doe snot have many built-in features for R language that Positron has out-of-the-box as well as laks key binding relevant to data science tasks.

1.  Download Positron from [https://positron.posit.co/download.html](https://positron.posit.co/download.html){target="_blank"}

::: {.callout-warning}
**Important:** Use "Windows 10, 11 x64 (system level install)", not the "user level install"
:::

2.  Make a "Software Installation Request" on eservice.

    -   Go to [eservices/](http://eservices/){target="_blank"}

    -   Select "[Software Installation Request](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg/en/software-installation-request?id=wbg_sc_catalog&sys_id=bd1e71b86f16d340db112d232e3ee4b7&table=sc_cat_item&searchTerm=Software%20installation){target="_blank"}"

    -   See [KB0076748](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=wbg_knowledge_article&sys_id=50a6a237971b6a500b41bf07f053af30&table=kb_knowledge&searchTerm=Software%20installation){target="_blank"} for more details.

3.  Once approved, you will have two paths to install Positron:

    -   ITS Pesonnel will connect to your computer remotely and will install Positron for you using admin password.

    -   You will need to use admin password to install Positron yourself.

    In either way, follow these installation instructions:

    -   Step 1: Copy the executable (exe) or installation folder to C:\WBG.

    -   Step 2: Launch the command shell (cmd.exe) as an administrator.

    -   Step 3: Navigate to C:\WBG in the command shell.

    -   Step 4: Set the user profile, TEMP, and TMP environments, and Launch the executable from the shell prompt by typing:

        ```
        set userprofile=c:\wbg\temp
        set temp=c:\wbg\temp\temp
        set tmp=c:\wbg\temp\temp
        Positron-20XX.XX.X-XXX-Setup-x64.exe
        ```

        Note: Replace `Positron-20XX.XX.X-XXX-Setup-x64.exe` with the actual filename of the Positron installer you downloaded.

### Step 4. Install Extensions in Positron

Extensions are add-ons that enhance the functionality of Positron.
To install extensions open the Extensions panel by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.

-   ![](images/extensions.png){width="40"}

There are many extensions available for Positron. Below are the key extensions to install for AI-assisted analysis:

-   [`Stata MCP` Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/DeepEcon/stata-mcp){target="_blank"} enables Model Communication Protocol (MCP) for Stata, allowing better context awareness for AI agents and allows running Stata code directly from Positron.

    `[](images/stata-mcp.png){width="80"}

    To install it:

    -   Open the Extensions panel in Positron.

    -   Search for "Stata MCP" in the Extensions panel.

    -   Click "Install" to add the extension to Positron.

    -   Now we need to set up the Stata executable path and version.

        1.  Go to Settings (`Ctrl+,` or File \> Preferences \> Settings),
        2.  Search for "Stata Path" (or `stata-vscode.stataPath`),
        3.  Set the path to your Stata executable folder `C:\Program Files\StataNow19\` - for most WB laptops and VDIs.
        4.  Search for "Stata Edition" (or `stata-vscode.stataEdition`) and set it to "mp" for Stata MP version.

    -   Now create a new Stata `.do` file and try running a simple command like `sysuse auto` to verify the setup.

    -   Results from Stata should appear in the "Output" panel. To show the output panel

        `Ctrl+Shit+P` and type `Output: Show Output Channels...` \> `Enter` \> `Stata`.

-   [`Quarto` Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quarto/quarto){target="_blank"} enables Quarto document editing and rendering in Positron.

    To install it:

    -   Open the Extensions panel in Positron.

    -   Search for "Quarto" in the Extensions panel.

    -   Click "Install" to add the extension to Positron.


## Connecting Github Copilot to Positron

This step should enable you to use Github Copilot coding agent and any LLM, such as Chat GPT or Antropic Claude with positron.

-   See [Positron Assistant: Getting Started](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html#step-3-use-positron-assistant) for the full overview of what it does.

### Step 1. Connect GitHub to Positron

Thie requires you to have a GitHub account first and then link it to the World Bank organization.
See GitHub Setup [@github-setup] instructions below if you dont have the account or did not link it to the WB organization. To connect GitHub to Positron:

1.  Open `Account`.

2.  Sign in to your GitHub account that is linked to the World Bank organization.

### Step 2. Enabling Positron Assistant in setting


1.  Open settings [positron.assistant.enable](positron://settings/positron.assistant.enable) and check the box to enable it.

### Step 3. Configure LLM Provider

By default, when you are logged into GitHub, Positron Assistant uses GitHub Copilot as the LLM provider. Github copilot does both: code completion, anwering questions in chat and agent-mode (able to run code directly).

Withing the Github Copilot, you can also configure other LLM providers, such as Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, etc.

If you want to use Anthropic Claude as the LLM provider or other LLMs follow instruction in [Configure language model providers](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html#step-3-use-positron-assistant){target="_blank"}.

Note: code completion feature will still be provided by GitHub Copilot extension.

### Step 4. Using Positron Assistant

1.  `Ctrl+Shift+P` \> `Help: Ask Positron Assistant` \> `Enter` to open it.

2.  In the input box that appears, type your question.

    For example.

    ```
    Write a Stata do file that loads the auto dataset and summarizes the price variable.
    Open it.
    Explain how to run it.
    ```
