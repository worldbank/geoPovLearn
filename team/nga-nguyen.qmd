## Bio

A Senior Economist who is passionate about how policies shape people's lives — and how where they live changes the story. She's worked across Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and the EU, combining solid economic analysis with a growing love for using spatial data to uncover new insights into welfare outcomes.

Her research has appeared in journals like the Journal of Economic Inequality, World Bank Economic Review, and Journal of Development Studies. These days, she's especially excited about turning geospatial insights into smarter, more grounded policies that deliver real impact.
